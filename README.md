# 📚 Library-Management-System (Java Console Application)

## 📝 Project Description

This is a **console-based Library Management System** built using **Java**, designed to manage books and user interactions in a library-like setting. The application implements core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and uses the **Java Collections Framework** for efficient data management. It also ensures **data persistence** using **File I/O and Object Serialization**.
